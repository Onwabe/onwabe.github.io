Overview
This project is a resume portfolio I found while navigating my GitHub account. I was impressed by it and decided to fork it to contribute and test my skills by working on a real-world project. My intention is to respect your original work while enhancing it.

#Recent Changes
I recently forked this project and made some updates to enhance its functionality and explore Git. Here’s a summary of my changes:

Added Image: I noticed your image was commented out, so I included it on the website.
Added Typing Effect: I implemented a typing effect to style your name and role.
Added JavaScript: I integrated JavaScript to add functionalities like the typing effect and menu toggle.
Intent
I want to clarify that my changes are made with respect for your original work. My goal is to learn more about Git and the development process by contributing to existing projects. I’m eager to gain feedback on my contributions.
